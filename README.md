# trespassing-detection
Trespassing control is often a challenge for countries. It allows people to cross borders and that may sometimes lead as a safety passage for anarchist to spread terror. This repo deals with a project that allows cameras to detect any trespassing in the area. it uses YOLO object detection model to detect people or guns or other illegal weapns and send a msg to concerned authorities. I used Flask as a backend tool to deploy the project
